### Run

The easiest way to play is through Node's pre-packaged executable:

npx teletyperacer
```
or install it globally with:

```bash
npm install -g teletyperacer
# then run with `typeracer`
```

The `npm` package is automatically built through GitHub Actions.

Or, install it with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/givensuman/teletyperacer
```

Lastly, it can be built from source with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/givensuman/teletyperacer
cd teletyperacer && go build
```

The original [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) game and concept was created by Alex Epshteyn. It's free to play and you should check it out if you haven't!
