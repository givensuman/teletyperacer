 # teletyperacer

play typeracer in your terminal

### Run

The easiest way to play is through Node's pre-packaged executable:

```bash
npx teletyperacer
```
or install it globally with:

```bash
npm install -g teletyperacer
# then run with `typeracer`
```

The `npm` package is automatically built through GitHub Actions.

Or, install it with Go. Note some functionality may be disabled in out-of-date installs:

```bash
go install github.com/givensuman/teletyperacer
```

Lastly, it can be built from source with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/givensuman/teletyperacer
cd teletyperacer && go build
```

### Acknowledgements

The original [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) game and concept was created by Alex Epshteyn. It's free to play and you should check it out if you haven't!

The `practice` mode is heavily inspired by [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com), another fantastic project worth your attention.
